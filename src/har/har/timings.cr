module HAR
  # This object describes various phases within request-response round trip.
  # All times are specified in milliseconds.
  #
  # The send, wait and receive timings are not optional and must have
  # non-negative values.
  #
  # An exporting tool can omit the blocked, dns, connect and ssl, timings
  # on every request if it is unable to provide them. Tools that can provide
  # these timings can set their values to `-1` if they donâ€™t apply.
  # For example, connect would be `-1` for requests which re-use an existing
  # connection.
  #
  # The time value for the request must be equal to the sum of the timings
  # supplied in this section (excluding any `-1` values).
  #
  # Following must be true in case there are no `-1` values
  # (entry is an object in `log.entries`):
  #
  # ```
  # entry.time == entry.timings.blocked + entry.timings.dns +
  #               entry.timings.connect + entry.timings.send + entry.timings.wait +
  #               entry.timings.receive
  # ```
